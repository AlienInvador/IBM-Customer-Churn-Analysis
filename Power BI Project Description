IBM Telecommunication Customer Churn Analysis using Power BI
This project showcases my data management and analytics skills using Power Query and Power BI by creating a report on IBM Telco customers in California during the third quarter. The analysis identifies key trends and patterns contributing to the high churn rate during this period, with an average churn score of 58.7.

Dataset Source:
The original dataset was obtained from Kaggle: Telco Customer Churn - IBM Dataset.

Project Steps and Insights:
Data Cleaning and Preparation:
I cleaned the raw data to ensure accuracy and consistency, addressing missing or duplicate entries. Using Power Query, I transformed the dataset into a structured format suitable for analysis.

Data Structuring:

Created pivot tables to organize the data efficiently.
Streamlined data fields to enable detailed insights and facilitate easier analysis.
Statistical Analysis:

Calculated key metrics such as:
Average churn score.
Average charges incurred by customers.
Average Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) score.
Visualization and Reporting:
Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard with:

A Churn Reasons chart highlighting the primary causes of customer churn.
Visual comparisons of churn rates based on gender and senior citizen status.
A concise summary table providing an overview of critical data points.
This comprehensive report provides actionable insights into churn patterns, equipping decision-makers with the tools to develop targeted strategies for customer retention and improved service delivery.
